Any files specific to a single day or marked as a copy were excluded."

Data was provided as above with most files being derived from [Hickey et al, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01168-7).
File names reflect the figures and data files from this paper.

The models included were E418, HCI005, Gar15-13, UCD4, UCD65 and MH18 (not from the specified paper).
Only Vehicle, SARM and P4 treated samples were of interest.

### Summary

As such, a *variability in the growth rate* was chosen to be 0.025 as this represented the 90th percentile of the non-UCD65 (ED9c) experiments, and if including this more variable experiment, this still is approximately equivalent to the 75th percentile.
This will also be a conservative over-estimate of the variability for the SARM-treated and highly responding lines.

For *initial tumour volume*, a value of 8 with inter-replicate variability of 0.4 will be appropriately conservative for those using a Vehicle control.
However, for those using an E2 control, an initial volume of 3 with variability of 1.2 will again provide a suitably conservative value.

For overall 'noise', a value of 0.25 will be representative for control samples, whilst this should be raised to 0.4 for treated tumours

In all calculations below a significance threshold of &alpha; = `r alpha` was used.
**This allows for multiple testing for up to 5 experiments using Bonferroni's adjustment**.
Any increase in the number of experiments will require a more stringent threshold again.

For simplicity, the same number of replicates were assumed to be performed in both treated and control arms of the experiments.

Fixed values for all simulations were defined as:

- General variability: &sigma; = 0.25 for controls and &sigma; = 0.4 for treated samples

### Vehicle Controls


```{r veh_res}
n_sim <- 1000
reductions <- c(0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.5)
veh_res <- list(
  tibble(
    nc = 6,
    nt = 6,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  ),
    tibble(
    nc = 8,
    nt = 8,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  ),
    tibble(
    nc = 10,
    nt = 10,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  )
) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  split(f = seq_len(nrow(.))) %>%
  mclapply(
    mutate,
    n_sig = replicate(
      n_rep,
      {
        mod <- suppressWarnings(
          lmer(
            log2_volume ~ days*treatment + (1|sample), 
            data = simulateData(
              n_control = nc, 
              n_treat = nt, 
              mn0 = runif(1, 7, 8.5),
              sd0 = runif(1, 0.11, 0.4),
              gr_control = runif(1, .04, 0.08),
              gr_sd =  runif(1, 0.007, 0.03),
              gr_reduction = reduction
            )
          )
        )
        coef(summary(mod))["days:treatmenttreated", "Pr(>|t|)"] < alpha
      }
    ) %>%
      sum(),
    power = n_sig / n_rep,
    mc.cores = 6
  ) %>%
  bind_rows()
```

Based on the observed data, simulations for experiments using a *Vehicle control* used Uniform distributions to sample values for the control experiments:

- Initial Tumour Volume: $\mathcal{U}(7, 8.5)$
- Variability in Initial Tumour Volume: $\mathcal{U}(0.11, 0.4)$
- Growth Rate: $\mathcal{U}(0.04, 0.08)$
- Variability In Growth Rate: $\mathcal{U}(0.007, 0.03)$

This effectively allowed sampling from a square encompassing the observed values for Vehicle controls in the above plots

```{r plot_veh_res, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap = "*Power curve for treatments using Vehicle controls. These tend to start with higher initial tumour volumes and lower varibility between replicates*"}
veh_res %>%
  mutate(
    se = sqrt(power*(1-power)/n_rep)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(reduction, power, colour = as.factor(nc))
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = power - se, ymax = power + se),
    width = 0.01
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = "Reduction in Growth Rate",
    y = "Power",
    colour = "Replicates"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Vehicle Controls")
```


### E2 Controls


```{r e2_res}
n_sim <- 1000
e2_res <- list(
  tibble(
    nc = 6,
    nt = 6,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  ),
    tibble(
    nc = 8,
    nt = 8,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  ),
    tibble(
    nc = 10,
    nt = 10,
    reduction = reductions,
    n_rep = n_sim
  )
) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  split(f = seq_len(nrow(.))) %>%
  mclapply(
    mutate,
    n_sig = replicate(
      n_rep,
      {
        mod <- suppressWarnings(
          lmer(
            log2_volume ~ days*treatment + (1|sample), 
            data = simulateData(
              n_control = nc, 
              n_treat = nt, 
              gr_reduction = reduction, 
              mn0 = runif(1, 2.3, 4.7), 
              sd0 = runif(1, 0.52, 1.3),
              gr_control = runif(1, 0.06, 0.13),
              gr_sd = runif(1, 0.011, 0.032)
            )
          )
        )
        coef(summary(mod))["days:treatmenttreated", "Pr(>|t|)"] < alpha
      }
    ) %>%
      sum(),
    power = n_sig / n_rep,
    mc.cores = 6
  ) %>%
  bind_rows()
```

Based on the observed data, simulations for experiments using a *E2 control* used Uniform distributions to sample values for the control experiments:

- Initial Tumour Volume: $\mathcal{U}(2.3, 4.7)$
- Variability in Initial Tumour Volume: $\mathcal{U}(0.52, 1.3)$
- Growth Rate: $\mathcal{U}(0.06, 0.13)$
- Variability In Growth Rate: $\mathcal{U}(0.011, 0.032)$

This effectively allowed sampling from a square encompassing the observed values for E2 controls in the above plots
