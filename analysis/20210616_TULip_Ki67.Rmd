# Introduction

The common measurement of Ki67 data is as a percentage of cells staining +ve for Ki67.

## Power Calculations

### Explanatory Notes

In this study a comparison of an Aromatase Inhibitor treated arm (Letrazole) with a double-treated arm (Letrazole + Testosterone Undecanoate).
The desired reduction in Ki67 for double-treated (L+TU) samples is an additional 20% beyond that seen by Letrazole alone.

Based on the values observed in [*Long-term outcome and prognostic value of Ki67 after perioperative endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early breast cancer (POETIC): an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial* (The Lancet, 2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(20)30458-7/fulltext), untreated samples were simulated using a truncated normal distribution with location &mu; = 0.065 and scale &sigma; = 0.19.
Truncation points were the values 0 & 1, and this gave distributions which provided broadly similar values for median and the IQR as obtained by this study.

For simulations, data were assumed to be drawn from a Truncated Normal Distribution bounded at a = 0 and b = 1.
Untreated Ki67 values were simulated from the Truncated Normal $\mathcal{N}$(&mu;~0~, &sigma;~0~) such that the resultant distribution strongly resembled those from *untreated samples* in the POETIC study.

For both treatments, values were simulated by specifying values *a~Let~* or *a~L+TU~* such that data could be simulated from the Truncated distribution $\mathcal{N}$(a&mu;~0~, &#8730;a&sigma;~0~).
This follows the principles of linear transformation of random variables.
However, it is important to note that a 75% reduction in the location parameter &mu;~0~ (i.e. a = 0.25) will *not result in a 75% reduction in either the mean or median values drawn from the transformed distribution.*

Whilst a non-responder rate to both compounds was simulated between 10% to 30%, it may of note that in [one early study](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/63/19/6523.long) up to 25% of patients failed to respond to Letrazole.
However, it should be noted that as part of the simulation process some non-responders may appear to be responders just by having low Ki67 values prior to intervention.
This is relatively representative of the true data where some non-responders will not be able to be identified unless matched Ki67 values are obtained pre/post intervention.
Importantly, **the non-responder rate was assumed to be equal between treatment groups**

In addition to non-responders, a *participant dropout rate of 5%* was included into simulations.

## Conclusion

Using 25% non-responders from the above power curves, and a significance threshold of &alpha; = `r alpha`:

- *Keeping group sizes equal* requires N = 100 (n~Let~ = 60; n~L+TU~ = 60) to achieve a 80% power (in the presence of &#8924;25% non-responders)
- *Including an additional 50% of participants in the combined treatment group* is able to achieve a power &#8925;80% at N = 100 (n~Let~ = 40; n~L+TU~ = 60)
- *Including double the number of participants in the combined treatment group* is able to achieve a power &#8776; 80% at N > 100 (n~Let~ = 34; n~L+TU~ = 68)

Importantly a *sample size of 110 participants* achieves a power > 80% for all combinations of n~L+TU~ and n~L~ and all non-responder rates &#8924;25%.
For 30% non-responders, the power is still within acceptable bounds at &#8776;75% for N = 110.
All simulations included a dropout rate of `r percent(formals(sim_data)$dropout)`
